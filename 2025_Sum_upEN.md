## Q1

### ⏱️ **ctime**

A C program designed to replace the Unix timestamp, which proved slightly less performant at nanosecond resolution. This program supports femtoseconds for timestamp display.

**Note**: Primarily an experimental project that calculates timestamps from CPU clock cycles.   

The technique, named "Timestamp CPU clock-cycle based computation and benchmark," evaluates the power of one or more processors to compute very short time intervals using the Time Stamp Counter assembly instruction available on most laptops and computers.
